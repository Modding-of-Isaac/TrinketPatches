# TrinketPatches
*Maintained @Martmists*

TrinketPatches is a mod that adds functions to trinkets to balance them more and make mechanics more interesting. This is my first mod, so any feedback is greatly appreciated!

### Features:

- Cancer has a 20% chance to damage you when entering an unexplored room (-5% for every luck up)
- Mom's locket will damage you for a full heart when going through curse room doors (secret room passages are not affected)
- Bloody Crown makes item rooms on non-womb floors inaccessible
- Silver Dollar has the same effect, but on shops instead.
- Stem Cell removes a soul or black heart on every new floor, if the player has any.
- Equality now checks if you have the same amount of red, soul and black hearts, and gives an all stats up as result.
- Bob's Bladder gives a 5% (+5% for every luck up) to fire an Ipecac tear.

### EID support included!
Default descriptions will get overridden to match the new ones.
This is compatible with any used language, but added descriptions will only be in english.
