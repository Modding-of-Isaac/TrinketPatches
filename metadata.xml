    <description>TrinketPatches is a mod that adds functions to trinkets to balance them more and make mechanics more interesting. This is my first mod, so any feedback is greatly appreciated!

Features:
- Cancer has a 20% chance to damage you when entering an unexplored room (-5% for every luck up)
- Mom's locket will damage you for a full heart when going through curse room doors (secret room passages are not affected)
- Bloody Crown makes item rooms on non-womb floors inaccessible
- Silver Dollar has the same effect, but on shops instead.
- Stem Cell removes a soul or black heart on every new floor, if the player has any.
- Equality now checks if you have the same amount of red, soul and black hearts, and gives an all stats up as result.
- Bob's Bladder gives a 5% (+5% for every luck up) to fire an Ipecac tear.
- Tick can be burnt off by walking into fires
- Match Stick deals an additional heart of damage when walking into fires

EID support included!
Default descriptions will get overridden to match the new ones.
This is compatible with any used language, but added descriptions will only be in english.</description>
